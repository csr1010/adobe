Used Angular Js to complete the task
  --> angular libraries , angular router for routing 
Used lazy loading concept , similar to require js 
  --> Acheived this by utilizing promise, deffered concepts from angular js, I used this to load files into DOM dynamically 
  on the fly when there is route match occured.
Followed MVC pattern
   --> Loaded the JSON from API you provided and bind JSON to a model.
   --> then I load the model into current scope and bind that model to view.
   --> Was able to sanitize the HTML content that comes up with the API you provided.
Routing and Navigation
   --> Used routing navigate between master and detail views
Reponsive design is acheived as well.
   --> Desktop = 4 columns
   --> tablet  = 2 columns
   --> Mobile  = 1 column
Detail View
   --> Full story of a box, is shown in details view, Also displayed tags,categories,Attachments
   --> Attachments can be downloaded as well.
